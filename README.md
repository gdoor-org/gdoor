_________________

The GDoor hardware adapter allows listening and controlling the bus and e.g. integrating a Gira door bell into a <b>smart home</b> like [Home Assistant](https://gdoor-org.github.io/documentation/homeassistant.html) or [openHAB](https://gdoor-org.github.io/documentation/openhab.html). It might serve as an DIY alternative to the Gira TKS-IP-Gateway. It supports the following features:

- (In development): Audio support via VOIP
- listening to the bus, e.g. to trigger notifications on mobile devices when a door bell button is pressed
- sending to the bus, e.g. to open the door

Receiving and sending video is currently neither supported nor plannend.

GDoor is a project to collect and document findings about the Gira Door System, all figured out by reverse engineering.
