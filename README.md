_________________

Gira is a german manufacturer of house appliances, including door systems.
These systems are connected via a proprietary two wire bus system.
GDoor is a project to collect and document findings about the Gira Door System, all figured out by reverse engineering.

The GDoor hardware adapter allows listening and controlling the bus and e.g. integrating a Gira door bell into a smart home. It might serve as an DIY alternative to the Gira TKS-IP-Gateway. It supports the following features:

- listening to the bus, e.g. to trigger notifications on mobile devices when a door bell button is pressed
- sending to the bus, e.g. to open the door

Receiving and sending audio/video is currently neither supported nor plannend.

Contributions are welcome!
